# Project Description

This project fetches jokes from an API and displays them on the page. The **Refresh** button reloads the page to show new jokes. The **Save** button stores selected jokes in `localStorage` and displays them in the **Library** tab.

**To-Do**: Improve the Library tab layout and styling.
